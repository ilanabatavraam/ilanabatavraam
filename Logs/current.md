	•	Happiness — satisfaction or happiness. For example, a high rating given to the app by a user.
	•	Engagement — user engagement. For example, the number of actions a user performs within a certain time frame.
	•	Adoption — adoption of the service. For example, the acceptance of a new update.
	•	Retention — user retention. For example, how many times a user opens the app over a certain period.
