- **Completed 10 exercises** in the "Intermediate SQL Practice" section on SQL-ex.
- Learned and practiced:
  - **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN**: Deepened understanding of combining data from multiple tables.
  - **HAVING Clause**: Filtering grouped data based on aggregate conditions.
  - **Subqueries**: Used nested queries for advanced filtering and calculations.
  - **Query Optimization**: Learned to use EXPLAIN and added indexes for better performance.
- Developed a stronger understanding of **data aggregation** and **advanced filtering** using SQL.

- I’ve started my Python journey. I’ve learned basic syntax and the differences from JavaScript. Multiplying lists and strings is fun. I’m going to spend around 2 hours a day to become “fluent” in this lang.

## 2025-01-09
- I've spent about 2 hours learning Python syntax, including functions and loops. 

## 2025-01-10
- I learned syntax of dict in Python. Seems very the same with js.

## 2025-01-11
- Officially started with pandas. I’ve begun learning about the syntax and opportunities.
- Learned about GIGO: garbage in — garbage out

## 2025-01-14
- Today I learned about preparing and cleaning data with python. Using duplicated() with reset_index(), isna(), fillna(), dropna(), etc.

## 2025-01-15
- I completed my first mini task with pandas by myself.
- HEART Model:
	•	Happiness — satisfaction or happiness. For example, a high rating given to the app by a user.
	•	Engagement — user engagement. For example, the number of actions a user performs within a certain time frame.
	•	Adoption — adoption of the service. For example, the acceptance of a new update.
	•	Retention — user retention. For example, how many times a user opens the app over a certain period.
	•	Task Success — literally, “success of tasks.” This metric indicates whether the user’s expectations from the service are being met.
- learning split-apply-combine method
- learning about .median() and .mean(), sort_values(),  groupby()

## 2025-01-16
- mini tasks with pandas + preparetion for jupiter notebook

## 2025-01-17
- starting my first data analysis project using Jupyter Notebook

## 2025-01-18
- prepared data for my first analysis
- started to learn about preparation data before analysis
- spent approximately 2 hours practicing data cleaning
- reviewed basic loc usage and studied logical indexing with loc. it's really interesting how we can work using .loc + lists with boolean data

## 2025-01-19
- worked with missing values in categorical variables
- worked with missing values in numerical variables

## 2025-01-20
- starting working with read_excel()
- changing types in python .to_numeric() (only float)
    errors='raise' — default behavior: an error is raised when encountering an invalid value, and the conversion to numbers is interrupted;
    errors='coerce' — invalid values are forcibly replaced with NaN;
    errors='ignore' — invalid values are ignored and remain unchanged.
- working with astype() 
- changing types to date using to_datetime() (datetime64)
    •	%d — day of the month (from 01 to 31)
	•	%m — month number (from 01 to 12)
	•	%Y — four-digit year (e.g., 2019)
	•	Z — standard date and time separator
	•	%H — hour number in 24-hour format
	•	%I — hour number in 12-hour format
	•	%M — minutes (from 00 to 59)
	•	%S — seconds (from 00 to 59)
- DatetimeIndex!! class that works with dates

## 2025-01-22
- working with try-except()
- working with merge()

## 2025-01-24
- starting with pivot tables. seems really familiar to excel

## 2025-01-28
- strated working with duplicates using drop_duplicates + subset (columns) + keep (first, last)
- lower()

## 2025-01-29
- dataframe decomposition
- apply() method
- Binning numerical values

## 2025-01-30
- processing dataframe rows with custom functions
    - axis=0 (column)
    - axis=1 (row)

## 2025-01-31
- knowing how to handle errors = key to being a great data analyst
- I’ve started working on my first pet project! 🎉
